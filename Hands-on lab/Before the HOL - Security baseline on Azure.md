# Security baseline on Azure before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.

    - Trial subscriptions will not work.

2. A machine with the following software installed (a Virtual Machine is created via the ARM template with most of this):

    - [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
    - [SQL Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms)
    - [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/)

3. An Office 365 email account or other email-based account.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will set up your environment for use in the rest of the hands-on lab. You should follow all the steps provided in the Before the hands-on lab section to prepare your environment *before* attending the workshop.

### Task 1: Configure Azure Security Center

1. Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the search box, type **Security Center**, then select it.

    ![Security Center is typed into the search box with the security center menu item highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/bhol_securitycenter.png "Open Security Center")

3. In the blade menu, select **Pricing & Settings**, then select the subscription you are running the labs in.

    ![In the blade select Pricing & Settings.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/bhol_securitycenter_pricesettings.png "Select Pricing and Settings")

4. If not already set, update the pricing tier to be **Standard**, then select **Save**.

    ![Standard pricing tier is selected.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/bhol_securitycenter_standardtier.png "Select the standard tier")

5. In the blade menu, select **Data Collection**.

    ![Auto provisioning is toggled off.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/bhol_securitycenter_datacollection.png "Set Auto Provisioning to Off")

6. Toggle the **Auto Provisioning** to **Off**.

> **Note**: Auto-provisioning is turned off for purposes of this lab, it is highly recommended that auto-provisioning is set to "on" in a production environment to ensure they security controls are applied.

### Task 2: Deploy resources to Azure

1. Select **Resource groups**.

2. Select **+Add**.

3. Type a resource group name, such as **azsecurity-\[your initials or first name\]**.

4. Select **Review + Create**, then select **Create**.

5. Select **Refresh** to see your new resource group displayed and select it. It may take a few minutes.

6. Select **Create a resource**, search for **template**, select **Template deployment (deploy using custom template)**, then select **Create**.

7. Select **Build your own template in the editor**.

8. Copy the contents of the [ARM template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/MCW-Security-baseline-on-Azure/master/Hands-on%20lab/Scripts/template.json) from the repo and then paste the ARM template into the window.

9. Select **Save**, you will see the dialog with the input parameters. Fill out the form:

    - Subscription: Select your **subscription**.

    - Resource group: Use an existing Resource group, or create a new one by entering a unique name, such as **azsecurity-\[your initials or first name\]**.

    - Location: Select a **location** for the Resource group.

        >**Note**: You may receive an error if you pick a region that does not support this lab. We recommend using East US, East US 2, West Central US, or West US 2.

    - Modify the **sqlservername** to be something unique such as **azsecurity-\[your initials or first name\]**.

    - Fill in the remaining parameters, but if you change anything, be sure to note it for future reference throughout the lab.

    - The **userObjectId** can be retrieved by navigating to Azure Active Directory blade and searching for your user account.  On the user account page, you will find your Object ID which you can copy and paste into the field.

    ![The Object Id for your Azure user account is highlighted.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image0.png "Your Azure Object Id")

    - Check the **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above** checkbox.

    - Select **Purchase**.

    ![The above information is entered in the form, and I agree to the terms and conditions stated above and Purchase are selected and highlighted at the bottom.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image6.png "Fill out the form")

10. The deployment will take 20-40 minutes to complete. To view the progress, select your resource group, then select the **Deployments** blade link, then select the **Microsoft.Template** deployment.

    ![Deployments is highlighted under Settings on the left side of the Azure portal, and Microsoft.Template is highlighted under Deployment Name on the right side.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image7.png "Select the Deployments link")

    - As part of the deployment, you will see the following items created:

       - Storage account

       - Three virtual networks (dbVNet, webVNet, mainVNet).

       - Three network security groups.

       - Four lab supporting virtual machines with associated network resources (db-1, web-1, paw-1, linux-1).

            - IIS is installed on web-1 via a DSC script from the GitHub repository.

            - Port 1433 is opened on the database server using a PowerShell script.
  
            - Paw-1 is used as a development machine for the labs to save on resources.  A Paw workstation would not be used as a development machine in production with Visual Studio and SQL Management Studio.  This was done to save on resource costs and setup complexity.

            > **Note**: Please reference [Understand secure, Azure-managed workstations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/devices/concept-azure-managed-workstation) and [Privileged Access Workstations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/securing-privileged-access/privileged-access-workstations) for best practices with PAW machines.

       - SQL Azure Server with sample database.

       - Azure Key Vault

       - Log Analytics Workspace with joined Azure Automation account.

    ![Created items list. This screenshot is a list of the items that were created, including the items listed above. ](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image8.png)

### Task 3: Download Google Chrome

1. Log in to the Virtual Machine created via the ARM template named **paw-1**.

2. Open Internet Explorer and browse to <https://www.google.com/chrome/>.

3. Select **Download Chrome** on the webpage and follow the prompts.

### Task 4: Download SQL Server Management Studio

1. From the **paw-1** Virtual Machine, open Google Chrome and browse to <https://aka.ms/ssmsfullsetup>.

2. After the installer has completed downloading, run it and follow the prompts to install SQL Server Management Studio.

### Task 5: Download GitHub resources

1. Open a browser window to the cloud workshop GitHub repository (<https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Security-baseline-on-Azure>).

2. Select **Clone or download**, then select **Download Zip**.

    ![Clone or download and Download ZIP are highlighted in this screenshot of the cloud workshop GitHub repository.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image3.png "Clone or Download Zip")

3. Extract the zip file to your local machine, be sure to keep note of where you have extracted the files (such as `c:\temp`). You should now see a set of folders:

    ![A set of extracted folders and files are visible in File Explorer: Hands-on lab, Whiteboard design session, HTMLLINKS.md, LICENSE, and README.md.](images/Hands-onlabstep-bystep-Azuresecurityprivacyandcomplianceimages/media/image4.png "Extract the zip file")

You should follow all steps provided *before* attending the hands-on lab.
